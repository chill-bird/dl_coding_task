# TODO

## General

- [x] Reset `constants.py`
- [x] Change reproduce script to use dedicated directories
- [x] Remove Flower-set
- [x] `README.md`: Explain functionality of `reproduce` script in more detail
- [ ] README files addden

### Nice-to-have

- [x] Download script? → is pw protected, so not that worth it
- [x] Outsource class mapping

## Task 1

- [x] Create split files

## Task 2

- [x] Dataset class
- [x] Check assignment notes: "Channels with indices 3,2,1 (in this inverse order it is equal RGB in the MS part)"
- [x] Change execution to current run directory instead of copying file to root directory
- [x] Adjust prediction script to reproduce script
- [ ] Hard coded directory for reproduce 

## Task 3

## Before Hand-in

- [x] RGB mode only
- [ ] Upload model output
- [ ] Create PDF for Task 2:
    – the names of the team of students working on it
    – what parameters need to be set, so that we can run your code
    – what py-file to run to compute the prediction on the test data using the final model
    – what py-file to run the reproduction routine using the final model
    – it shows the validation performance graphs and the final performance number on test
    data using the saved selected model
    – the top-5 and bottom-5 images
    – any links to cloud storage for things (e.g. saved models) which are too large to upload in
    elearning.
